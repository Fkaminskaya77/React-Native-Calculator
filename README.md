# React-Native-Calculator

## Why did you choose this subject?
I chose to start learning about React Native, because of my interest  to challenge myself, but also to create full stack project of building a weather application. React Native is a powerful tool for building mobile applications, and choosing to learn it can lead to many opportunities in the tech industry.

## How were you first made aware of it? 
I was first made aware of React Native through my Software Engineering Bootcamp course at General Assembly

## What problem does React Native solve?
React Native is a popular and widely-used framework for building mobile applications that can run on both iOS and Android devices. It is a cross-platform development which allows developers to write code once and deploy it on both iOS and Android, saving time and effort in building separate apps for each platform.

## How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?
Conceptually building cross-platform mobile apps require developers to use different programming languages and frameworks for each platform, which was time-consuming and error-prone. React Native solves this problem by allowing developers to write code once in JavaScript and use it to build mobile apps for both platforms.

## What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?
My opinion after building a calculator appication with React Native, was this is definitely an awesome way to build mobile applications rather then just through a web server. It reminded me a lot of React, but with a twist. It was easy to follow with the documention React and React Native provides, but defienitly a  big open source library, with lots of different extensions features. It can become a little confusing or overwhelming if you do not know React. Really knowing React and Javascript helps a lot for beginners. Like any program langauge you learn, it just takes sometime to learn the ropes and test out everything React Native has to offer. Overall, I think this is really great programming langauge, that everyone can learn if you want to work with front-end mobile development and I hope to continue to enjoy it even more as I get familar with React Native.

## What resources do you recommend for interested students?
I recommended having an understanding of React, and JavaScript before jumping into React Native. When you are ready to build with React Native start off with some thing small like a calculator application or stopwatch. Lots of documention and videos(youtube) that can walk you through simple application building in case you get stuck.
